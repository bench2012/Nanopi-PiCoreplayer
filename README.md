# Nanopi-PiCoreplayer
PiCoreplayer on Nanopi Neo 2 / Plus 2 at least with jivelite, properly without the nice web interface

This is my atttempt to create a Squeezelite based player with GUI. I say create, it's more like jerry racking a few program developed by others and try to fit them into Nanopi Neo 2/Plus 2. 

I have not touch programming for at least 20 years and although worked in the IT field, I am no programmer, although Unix/Linux is my line of work.
